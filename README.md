# CS-350 Emerging System Architecture and Technology
## Portfolio
#### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This thermostat project was to make CS3220 board function as thermostat with it's temperature sensor. If it gets cold, LED will turn on signaling if it was an AC, heater would run. And if it gets hot, heater will turn off.
#### What did you do particularly well?
I was able to implement LED light turning on and off and setting the set point.
#### Where could you improve?
I wasn't able to implement the task scheduler for continuosly running the tasks. I need more knowledge on task scheduler in embedded systems and idea.
#### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding ZyBooks materials and Tutorialspoint's tutorial on embedded systems.
#### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I can transfer skills I learned to variety of device programming and schematics in mostly used furnitures and gadgets. These skills involved working and programming a board and I believe I can use it to program and work on more embedded systems like blood pressure measurer or a digital watch.
#### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have made sure that the code is upscalable and reusable by using many functions and adding comments to make the code easier to understand. Users can add more features with timers and task scheduler.
